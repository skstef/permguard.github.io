description: Understanding the concept of Policy in Permguard.
---

In **Permguard**, multiple ledgers can be created, and each ledger can have multiple **policies**.

:::note
In the [PharmaGovFlow base example](/learn/learn-pharma-govflow/) policies such as **`platform-manager`** are created.

## Policy

A `policy` defines how permissions and denials are expressed within a trust model, describing which actions are allowed or rejected under specific conditions.

:::note
**Policies** are not tied to a single `policy language`: different languages or representations can be used as long as they produce consistent and verifiable authorization outcomes.
